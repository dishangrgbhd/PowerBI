This is my End-to-End Weather Dashboard project using weatherapi
In this project, I imported weather data of 3 days using API call to weatherapi.com for 4 places that I am conscious about the weather updates(Current temperature, AQI, chances of rain, Humidity and various other indicators);
they are Greenwich(my uni), London, Reading(my term address) and Pokhara(my hometown).
I have used the powerbiservice to make sure it manually refreshes at 12 am and pm. I couldn't deploy it as a webapp because of the free subscription restrictions.
However, I have setup an alert which send alert to my Teams account if the chances of rain becomes greater than 50%.
